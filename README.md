# Red Wine Quality Classification with Machine Learning
Wine classification by quality is a difficult task as taste is very subjective. There are many components of wine with the main ones being water, alcohol, acid, sugar, and phenolic compounds. Through machine learning, we aim to find out if physicochemical features of wines affect the quality of wine. We will be able to derive quantitative and unbiased results using machine learning models. We will be using three types of supervised machine learning model namely Logistic Regression Model, K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN), and Decision Tree. This information can be useful for research, marketing purposes or to improve the production and quality of wine.
